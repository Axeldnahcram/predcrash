# PredCrash

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

In the movie Minority Report, the Precrime agents manage to avoid crimes even before they happen, thanks to the visions of 3 individuals, precogs. We intend to do the same with road accidents. What once seemed like science fiction is no longer, the Los Angeles and Santa Cruz police departments use artificial intelligences to predict crimes, and we think we can design an algorithmic precog for road safety.

### Prerequisites

You will need python 3 and ideally an IDE like Pycharm.
All the details can be found here:

* [Setup Conda and Python](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) - An easy tutorial for an easy installation
* [Setup Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/install-and-set-up-pycharm.html) - Installing Pycharm




### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

You will have to go into the repositery where you cloned the repository, then type 

```
pip install -e .
```

Make sure to stay up to date with the most recent evolution with 

```
git fetch --all
git rebase origin/master
```

There are 4 distincts module, in a new update you will also need docker to setup the sql base. I will add the details of the modules in a later update.

## Objectives

* **Short term** : 

*Design an interface allowing to visualize the places of the various accidents and allowing to see their characteristics, to identify the areas at risk*

*Create a first algorithm of test of prediction and to evaluate its precision.*
 
*Improve this first algorithmic throw until obtaining coherent and rather precise results*

*  **Long term** : 

*Transmit this computer program to the public authorities in order to prevent to a certain extent the fatal accidents*
